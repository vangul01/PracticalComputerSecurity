Computer Security

To try out hacking legally
	Bug Bounty Programs

5
Referer: who referred you to another page, click on link on a page, page is referrer
6
name/value pair appears on URL
string that can be used for Post Requests
difference between Get and Post
	dont use Get to send sensitive info b/c it shows up in URL
	and it shows up in browsers/servers LOGS
	it shows up in browsing history
	it shows up in bookmark
every request can be forged
USE POST!
7
you can do attacks based on responses from servers
8
cookie issued from server, browser sends back cookie for every request
optional attributes: secure and Http Only has lack of security issues
9
Way to keep content separate from one another
If web browser permits scripts, must come from same origin
with script you can access anything from origin page and change it,
script run on one page can modify stuff on another page of the same origin
14
attack vectors, weaknesses, IMPACT to determine ranking of web hacks
16
confidentiality - whatevers being communicated is unreadable, encrypted
authentication - this is exactly the person youre talking to if you see the certificate
	if browser shows certificate can be validated, its who you think they are
19
server and web developer should not trust anything on client side, everything can be forged
	ie use cookies, user cant modify cause itll be seen
20
whatever is hidden value on a form can still be modified
	save file and locally run it
	set up a web proxy
Burp Suite- turn on web proxy to point to certain IP
			intercept and modify, send request back to server
You can modify outgoing and ingoing
24
hidden or disabled field was probs for testing purpose and was never deleted, 
try sending back to server with value and maybe itll still accept
25
validate on the server side since youre not going to trust anything from client side
log and alert weird inputs, multiple attempts
27
using HTTPS to transmit login info is secure enough? Yes
multifactor login will help improve security? Yes!

Design flaws are that you dont want the design to be a certain way
implementation flaws are that there are some problems with the way things function
34
backdoor password: if super awesome password matches with admins password, you can access everyones pws
41
If i get control of session, I get everything, without having to do password stuff
you can obtain something from person like their cookies for their account and use that
50
symmetric encryption: need same code to encrypt and decrypt
