Computer Security

-3 topics for today: phishing attacks, passwords, insider attacks

to steal login credentials
-brute force
-social engineering (phishing attacks)
-searching
-installing key logger

attack techniques tie threat with vulnerability

2.4
-take credentials without them knowing you took them
-with login credentials --> identity theft
-mass emailing phishing attacks
-spear phishing is targeted to an individual
	ie Dear Jeff
-whaling is targeted to CEOs or execs of a company

2.5
-is email directed to you?? is grammar correct? where is it coming from? requires immediate action/urgent
-you can also hover over the link and see where it is directed to
-uses fear tactics...someone tried to take out money from your bank, something went wrong, download this link

2.6
manage account -> security google to know what apps have access

2.8
2 ways to check if email came from a specific domain or not, whether its spam or not
1. Sender Policy Framework (path based)
	sender of email will publish IP address of post, checking how email traversed path 
2. Domain Key Identified Mail (signature based)
	Sender has public key available, you can check if message was sent from particular domain or not with security key
These dont check against the "from" field of the email, only if its coming from correct domain

We need DMARC! Will check if particular domain is the same as the "from" field

2.13
-attackers can obscure URLs very well
-Punycode is representation of UNICODE in ASCII, to protect browsers from lookalike domain names, they makes the domain name change if one char is in a different language
-to check, you can check the certificate

2.15
-to detect picture in picture attack, always have browsers in max

2.18
-DNS Spoofing attack is changing IP address to go to attackers IP address

2.21
-phishing alert toolbars in firefox, it changes the color of the toolbar
-will check against phishing tanks database, will identify if one of phishing website is one of the ones that are in the database

2.23
-password management tool (lastPass) will only autofill on the correct website, lastPass will help you 

2.27
-we get trained to click on links because legit companies send us links to click on

2.29
-Maltego collects info on people
-toolkit can help you clone sites, but dont do it unless you can anonymize yourself

2.36
-Hash your password to make it unreadable, you cannot reverse back

169 --> 20 nanoseconds to crack
1d09_wk@!dj3 --> a long ass time

avoid words that exist
use sentences or phrases as passwords

2.36
-to get a keylogger onto someones computer...
	have it downloaded from email
	inject it into vulnerable website

1.38
-timing attack: you can tell how much of the password is correct based on the time it takes to tell you the passwords dont match

1.39
-a fix for this is to read through the whole passwords and not return false upon encountering an unmatching character

1.40 
-introduce a random number (called salt) into password
-instead of just hashing your input, you first add the salt and then hash it to get a different output
-when we store passwords, we store with one way encryption, you decipher but dont decipher back
-rainbow tables are precomputed hash
-once you have access to a password file, you just have to check if the hash matches with a precomputed table
-This is why salt is important, once added to precomputed hash, you get different pw

1.44
-insider threats are
