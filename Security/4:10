Security Lecture

HW4 is due May 1st
Everything from lecture 1 -> presentation week can be on the final

Security Testing
Software Testing vs Security Testing (emphasizes what an application should NOT do)

testing can only show that bugs exist, not that bugs dont exist
its more likely to find more bugs when you see one because programmers usually make similar 	mistakes throughout the program
you wouldnt fix a bug you knew about because you might not have time to do so
	also, if you fix this problem, it might reveal and create more problems
	bugs found later cause more defects
the goals of a software tester are to 
	find bugs early on, fix bugs

TERMINOLOGY WILL NOT BE ON EXAM

black box testing -> you cant see code, you do input and see output

	equivalence partitioning
	*boundary value analysis* if values are 1-31 youd test 0 and 32, and ascii code vals too

white box testing -> you can see the code, see how its implemented in detail, 
					 code gives you extra knowledge and you can come up w more test cases

	control flow testing
	junit to test java code with multiple tests

Security Testing = cover the attackers mindset as well, covers security functions

	white hat = developer tested, testing for positives and that everything works as it should
		ie: verify that account is disabled after 3 attempts to login
			illegal characters are stripped out of URL

	black hat = testing for negatives, intentional attacks cannot compromise the system
		ie: system shall not allow for data to be altered or destroyed, system shall not be compromised if stuff goes wrong

	once you combine stuff or make changes to network settings, you cannot assume that it will be secure

**Penetration Testing: testing for negatives approach/black-box testing 
	closely resembles what an attacker would do
	*a system that fails penetration testing is know to have faults; one that passes is known only to not have the faults that were tested for
	NOTHING IS CERTAIN!

	in order to test something, you need to have prior knowledge of what must be tested

FOR HW 2: sessionID = whatever is PHPSESS cookie, edit GET 302 to 200 from search page

for Nmap you shouldn't do against other peoples permission
nmap (machine, IP address) and you can see the port and domain of that IP
	if some ports are available, you can try
sudo nmap -O IPAddress
	-O is to detect what kind of service is being used at a certain port
sudo nmap _A IPAddress (-A is aggressive scanning)

metasploit = run in your VM, dont try w other peoples stuff
msf > show exploits 	
msf > search				search for certain exploits ie: mysql exploits
msf > search mysql_login
msf > info 
msf > use (youre gonna use a specific module)

msf > set USERNAME root
msf > info
msf > run		(wont work cause root isnt a username....BUT if you had a log of un/pws...)

metasploitable = server you can try metasploit on

once you get into someones server, you can insert backdoor, upload malware, etc
google hack db

***nessus.org scans for vulnerability
